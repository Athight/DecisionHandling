# DecisionHandling
Proof of concept for a simple decision making game

Current TODO list:
Before next time:
Create a repo/project - Github - Jaram
5-6 event examples (or as many as it takes) + ensuring each mechanic is showcased - ready for event input tool scoping (write a few each so we get a range of ideas)
Install Python (Zoe)
Plan next meeting (weekday evening once a month ish) ~24th April? Or Group night Courtney canâ€™t come to - maybe next meeting should be looking at other open source projects with similar mechanics - get ideas


Plan 1
